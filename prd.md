# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Title: RAG-based AI Assistant for Banking Knowledge Base

### Objective
Develop an AI assistant using LangChain to answer questions about loan products, regulatory requirements, and internal policies from a diverse set of banking documents.

### Key Features
- Ingest and process various document types (handbooks, regulatory manuals, policy docs, rate sheets)
- Table-aware and cross-reference-preserving chunking
- Vector search over embedded document chunks
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate, context-rich answers
- Compliance and consistency safeguards for sensitive banking information
- Cost-optimized architecture with support for local and cloud LLM/vector DB options

### Technical Requirements
- Use LangChain for all core RAG components
- Support for both premium (cloud) and cost-effective (local) deployment modes
- Modular design for easy extension and maintenance

### Success Criteria
- Accurate answers to banking queries, including those requiring table or cross-reference context
- Consistent and compliant responses
- Cost analysis and recommendations for different deployment scenarios
- Clear documentation and reproducible setup

### Deliverables
- Complete codebase with modular RAG pipeline
- Documentation (README, architecture diagram, chunking strategy)
- Cost-Effective RAG Implementation Guide
- Example/test documents and queries
